Consumer spending on gaming loot boxes and skins worldwide is predicted to hit $50 billion (USD) by 2022. Virtual try-on experiences are an excellent use case for AR in retail: allowing consumers to preview products to scale digitally in their own homes, on their own bodies, and then instantly purchasing the corresponding physical product.

Let's dive deep into the reason for the lack of industry growth in the field. There is a steady flow of investments in the augmented reality app market, and the general background is more than positive. However, all these investments are yet to pay off big time. Part of the reason is that no one has figured out a distinct AR-related Business Model that will work long-term; besides, probably, the gaming industry. Sure, startups are popping up with more and more outlandish concepts at hand and many big companies are trying out various AR-related solutions, but there is one thing that should be noted - all these solutions are integrated into the business models that can be effective with or without an AR solution.",Object(o.jsx)("br",{})," ",Object(o.jsx)("br",{}),"The biggest AR product of recent times - Pokemon Go broke even only because of the power of the brand.

However, there is a ray of light in the form of industrial companies. Why? They have enough financial resources to boost development, and there are plenty of fields where AR technology might come at handy. Let\u2019s name a few: Proof of Concept for construction projects; Discrepancy Checking; Construction Progress Monitoring; Hidden infrastructure visualization; Maintenance Instructions; These kinds of applications have the potential to establish an augmented reality technology not as a toy but as a viable helping tool that improves the overall quality of the end product One of the best hardware startup examples of this situation where the challenge was successfully navigated is Fitbit. Though there have been many IoT sensor products designed for different applications including fitness, Fitbit managed to not only innovate on the product offering but it also found a sustainable business model to scale revenue, helping them cross the chasm of innovation to reach mainstream customers. But why is creating a great business model so difficult? Why don\u2019t more startups start first with the perfect business model and then seek technology innovation? And why is it often the second or third waves of startups which have a higher success rate than previous ones? All of these questions are valid and require a deep dive into the obstacles associated with being a pioneer leading a new industry.

It is one of the ways to secure its compatibility and contribution to the overall development of the technology. At the moment, this is the thing that is under construction for Augmented Reality. The reason is simple - it\'s too soon. The technology is too new, and it is still coming to its own both in hardware and software terms (despite "technically" being around for a while.) So what\u2019s the problem? Without standards, every augmented reality-related project is a thing of its own barely compatible with the others. That complicates the process of unifying solutions to the greater whole which makes the overall development of the technology much slower than it could have been if everyone had been on the same page.

Due to inconsistencies in augmented reality programming, oversight, and negligence, there is a legitimate chance of getting into trouble without meaning to do so. The biggest issue is that no actual regulation designates what is allowed and what is not in the augmented reality environment. This means the technology can be used with malicious intent just as it can be used for entertainment. For example, the \u201ctry before you buy\u201d option for clothing, but instead of overlaying the cloth on your body someone may overlay another nude body and spread it to damage your reputation or blackmail. Or AR can be used to hijack accounts via surveillance and mining data output by slightly manipulating and overlaying AR content (just as in ad stacking fraud schemes). Part of the problem is a lack of awareness about these problems. People don\u2019t understand how sensitive the subject is.

These elements are driving attention away from reality which may cause a potentially dangerous situation. For example, remember all the news about people hurting themselves while playing Pokemon Go? Well, it is just the tip of an iceberg. Augmented Reality, while being a worthwhile addition to the proceedings, can also serve as a significant distracting factor. This is why automobile manufacturers are so reluctant with implementing AR displays - it is more of a liability than the actual advantage for the driving process.

It is currently leading the top of unsolved problems in augmented reality in terms of being threatening to derail an industry. The majority of AR-related content available at App Stores is mostly a showcase of simple tricks and not much else. Its goal is to present some brands as forward-looking and cunning. It is designed to be a one-off affair. Sure, AR technology is still in its infancy, but if you look at what augmented reality development companies are trying to pull off with more or less the same tools (all HoloLens or Google Cardboard projects related to Healthcare or Education) - the solutions above seem a bit lacking. Part of the reason for this problem is because of a lack of expertise in the field. There are not enough developers who have a firm grasp on technology and can deliver an accessible and useful experience. The other big problem looming over the AR industry is the lack of credible use cases for AR technology. At the moment, the majority of AR apps are one-trick ponies that can do one thing which can be done without their assistance with the same level of effectiveness. Augmented Reality is an additional element to other activities by design - it must significantly contribute to the process either by providing additional information more conveniently or providing assistance in performing specific actions. Part of the reason why it is so is that of the very nature of AR - it is an addition, augmentation of the other thing, and the only way for it to be successful is to be a natural extension that makes the overall activity easier and more effective, which comes with tries and fails. AR displays for cars seems like a good idea on paper, but not a useful solution in practice. On the other hand, AR in medical or engineering training can be very helpful.

However, the situation will probably revert with a couple of \u201ckiller apps\u201d that will prove the worth of technology in one swift sweep. The other part of the problem is that the public, for the most part, is not aware of the benefits of augmented reality in various fields.

Despite the popularity of Augmented Reality technology steadily growing over the past few years, there is still a significant problem in keeping an audience using Augmented Reality applications in a long-term perspective.

Considering that the majority of the target audience will not likely purchase AR gear due to its impractical and high prices - smartphones remain a preferred function and since they have certain augmented reality app design limitations - it neuters the whole point of implementing AR solution to the mix. What\u2019s the solution to this problem? It is a question of time when the price for AR gear will drop to a mass consumer acceptable level.

These ethical considerations need to be taken into account in terms of AR. Currently, there is no regulatory infrastructure in place to moderate the development and deployment of AR technology. What is even more worrying is that the speed at which technology is advancing is too fast for the traditional legislative system to account for. Blockchain technology is an example of this. As soon as a bill is passed new features have been added and created rendering the bill more or less obsolete. The control over AR software should be in the hands of customers so they can make the decisions with regard to what they want to see and what data is made accessible. Like all technology, AR is a two-edged sword and needs to be correctly wielded in order to be effective. With high power comes great responsibility and AR is such a power. While it is fantastic that you can easily navigate through the streets using your augmented reality app, public spaces become a sort of "hijacked." Remembering the Pokemon Go and the rather sensitive story about how people go to the Holocaust Museum to catch "that one pokemon" they need for the collection? It is also important to remember that when people are using augmented reality apps, they are sort of "located" in two worlds - one real and another virtual.
