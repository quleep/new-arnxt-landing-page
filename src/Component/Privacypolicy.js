                <b>Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: </b>
                Quleep Services may include third-party advertising and links to
                other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may
                collect information about you when you interact with their
                content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                third-party advertising at Quleep, including interest-based ads,
                please read our <a href="/">Interest-Based Ads policy</a>. To

                <b>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: </b>We provide ad
                companies with information that allows them to serve you with
                more useful and relevant Quleep ads and to measure their
                effectiveness. We never share your name or other information
                that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an
                advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier.
                For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we
                will share your advertising identifier and data about that event
                so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again.
                Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
                relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about
                how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the{" "}
